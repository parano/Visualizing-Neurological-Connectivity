![Summary](summary.png)

Understanding dense, time-varying networks lies at the heart of long-standing challenges in scientific domains, especially biology. We construct a focused visualization tool for neurological functional connectivity data. We apply multiple filtering techniques â€“ animation and selecting by inclusion/exclusion - to make displays less overwhelming for general and expert audiences. We also allow filtering with a bootstrapped confidence level and support 2-way interactive visual hypothesis testing, to bring the noise and complexity of the data into context. Our animation display also supports casual use and inquiry into the underlying data for a general audience.
